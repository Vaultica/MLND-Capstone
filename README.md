This repository contain a Capstone proposal and project submission for Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree

The dataset is the Lending Club loan data held in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data

This dataset can also be downloaded from the Lending Club's website: https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action

A loan.csv file is the only file used as input to build a model and make predictions in the Jupyter notebook.

The data dictionary is also accessed from the notebook and is very useful to gain a good understanding of this dataset: https://resources.lendingclub.com/LCDataDictionary.xlsx
